# Relationship -> Activation -> Retention (R-A-R) is the founder growth spine this
# linter scores. It is the same loop the advisor runs on the founder's own
# company: earn trust, get them to first value fast, then keep them and expand.
# Why a loop and not a funnel: retained users are the cheapest acquisition you
# have, so retention feeds the top of the next cohort.
#
# Motions this borrows from, in plain terms:
#   - Growth loops over funnels, retention as the engine of acquisition: the
#     product-led trilogy of acquisition / retention / monetization loops.
#   - Time-to-value: shorten sign-up to the aha moment, and pick an activation
#     metric because it correlates with retention, not because it looks big.
#   - A use-case portfolio split by return horizon and risk: ship the small
#     proven bets now, build the connective ones, narrate the high-ceiling one.
